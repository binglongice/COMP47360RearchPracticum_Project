        <h3>Welcome to Our <br /><span>Service</span></h3>
        <p><span>Our application aims to answer two main questions. </span></p>
          <h4>New café owners</h4>
          <p>For prospective café owners we hope to answer the question of where is the best location to set up a new café. We’re aiming to provide these prospective owners with information on the busyness of different areas of Manhattan at different times, as well as information on property prices and the number of other cafés in these areas. Users will be able to compare these different features in order to make a decision as to where they should locate their café.</p>
          <h4>Existing café owners</h4>
          <p>For existing café owners we will answer the question of what are the peak hours of busyness in the area where their café(s) are located, to allow them to make informed decisions regarding staffing levels / operating hours. </p>
